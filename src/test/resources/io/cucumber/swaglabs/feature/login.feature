Feature: Login Functionality

  Background:
    Given I am on the login page

  Scenario: Successful login
    When I enter username "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be logged in successfully

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    When I enter username "<username>" and password "<password>"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "<message>"
